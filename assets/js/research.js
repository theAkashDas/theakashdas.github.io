    abstract:
      "Stewart platform is one of the most documented and researched-on parallel robot today. It has uses ranging from military tanks, flight simulators and so on. This Stewart Platform has 6 degrees of freedom, consisting of an upper platform and a lower base connected by six extensible linearly actuated legs. This paper involves analysis of inverse kinematic equations which lead to precise calculation of the length of each leg required for a given orientation and position of the platform. Then a MATLAB script is coded with the equations and we get the result with user input values. Finally, some future scopes of this paper are discussed.",

    abstract:
      "Solar energy is clean source of energy that has a much lower environmental impact than conventional energy. Solar energy has been increasing in a wide range of applications. Even though the wide usages of solar energy, the efficiency is not up to mark. Upon scheffler dish principle in practical the solar panel is parabolic in shape. This paper focuses on low cost dual axis solar tracking system to magnify the use of solar energy. To enhance the efficiency, combination of two types of solar tracking designs are implemented. LDR and servo motor is selected as the driving mechanism of the model. Dual axis is more acceptable as it's efficiency is more. The four active sensors present constantly monitor the sun and rotates the panel towards the direction of maximum intensity obtained. With the implementation the proposed configuration the additional energy generated is around 25% to 30%.there is very less consumption of energy by the system itself. The system have increased efficiency and reduced cost so that it can be implemented mainly in rural area.",
